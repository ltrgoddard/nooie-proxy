"""the account session from the last run, so this one need not sign in.

every sign-in is a call on an account layer that counts them, and a camera
that retries is signing in over and over. nooie does not say when a token
expires, so nothing here does either: a stored session is used until it is
refused, and being refused costs one sign-in, which is what signing in
unconditionally costs anyway.

kept beside the identity, at the same permissions: it holds session secrets.
NOOIE_SESSIONS names a file to share instead. a sign-in ends every other
session on the account, so installs that each signed in would evict one
another; sharing one file makes it one session for all of them.
